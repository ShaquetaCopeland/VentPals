  <!-- PROBLEM -->
  <section class="problem">
    <h2>Kids Are Having Big Feelings — With No Instruction Manual</h2>

    <p>
      Children experience anger, sadness, excitement, fear, and frustration long before they’re taught what those feelings mean.
      Schools focus on academics. Parents are overwhelmed. And kids are left to guess.
    </p>

    <p>
      When children don’t understand their emotions, they don’t learn self-control — they learn to react.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ROOT CAUSE -->
  <section class="root-cause">
    <h2>The Problem Isn’t the Feelings. It’s the Missing Education.</h2>

    <ul class="cause-list">
      <li>Feelings are treated as problems instead of signals</li>
      <li>Emotional responses are dismissed or punished</li>
      <li>Children aren’t taught where feelings come from</li>
      <li>Kids aren’t shown how to regulate instead of suppress</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="anchor-quote">
      “When kids don’t understand their feelings, they learn shame or avoidance — not awareness.”
    </p>

  <!-- SOLUTION -->
  <section class="solution">
    <h2>VentPals Teaches Emotional Literacy — Not Just Expression</h2>

    <p>
      VentPals meets children where they are — quietly, playfully, and safely — and helps them build
      emotional skills they’ll use for life.
    </p>

    <div class="pillars">
      <div class="pillar">
        <h3>AI-Guided Self-Expression</h3>
        <p>Journaling, drawing, and voice tools help kids express feelings they don’t yet have words for.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="pillar">
        <h3>Gamified Emotional Learning</h3>
        <p>Birds, growth stages, and progress celebrate awareness — not performance.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="pillar">
        <h3>VentPals Circles (Optional)</h3>
        <p>Small, anonymous peer groups that help children realize they’re not alone — introduced only when ready.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="pillar">
        <h3>Parent Support Without Invasion</h3>
        <p>Parents receive insight and guidance without access to private thoughts or conversations.</p>

  <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
  <section id="how-it-works" class="how-it-works">
    <h2>Private → Supported → Confident</h2>

    <ol class="journey">
      <li>
        <strong>Check In With a Feeling</strong>
        <p>The child chooses a bird that reflects how they feel.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Understand the Source</strong>
        <p>AI helps explore where the feeling came from.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Learn Emotional Choices</strong>
        <p>Visual games teach how feelings inform choices — not control them.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Progress Is Celebrated</strong>
        <p>Growth is tracked privately with no comparison or judgment.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Circles (When Ready)</strong>
        <p>Optional small-group sharing builds confidence and empathy.</p>
      </li>
