      Founders’ Dedications
    </h1>
    <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl text-purple-700 mb-4">
      A love letter to the six children whose emotional worlds became the wings of VentPals.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700">
      VentPals was not created in a boardroom or a lab.  
      It was born in a home — in the real, messy, beautiful emotional lives of six children who taught their mother how many different ways a heart can grow.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
      Each bird in the VentPals flock carries the story of one child.  
      Not their names. Not their faces. Their truths.  
      These dedications are the roots of the entire emotional universe.

  <!-- DEDICATION CARDS -->
  <section class="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-4 py-10 space-y-10">

    <!-- SABLE -->
    <div class="bg-white/90 rounded-3xl shadow-md p-6 flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-8">
      <img src="assets/images/sable-percher.png" class="h-48 drop-shadow-xl">
      <div class="flex-1">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-purple-800 mb-2">Sable — Resilience & Strength</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Dedicated to a boy who carried more than most, learned from every mistake,  
          and grew into a man defined not by his past, but by his strength.  
          Sable honors the child who navigates two worlds, the teen who refuses to repeat the pain he lived through,  
          and the adult who stands steady, grounded, and self‑aware.  
          Sable teaches that strength isn’t loud — it’s earned.

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Dedicated to a brilliant mind who was never given the map he needed,  
          so he learned to build his own.  
          Lumen honors the child who learns outside the lines,  
          the student who needed a different kind of teaching,  
          and the young man still discovering who he is.  
          Lumen reminds kids that they’re not broken — they’re built differently, and beautifully.

          Dedicated to a bright, unshakeable girl who carries her storms in silence and shines anyway.  
          Echo honors the child who feels deeply but shows little,  
          the friend everyone leans on,  
          and the young woman who deserves to be understood without having to explain herself.  
          Echo whispers that quiet feelings still matter.

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Dedicated to a blazing spark of a boy whose energy fills every room and whose love runs deep.  
          Flicker honors the child who moves faster than the world,  
          the middle kid who fights to be seen,  
          and the heart that shines even when misunderstood.  
          Flicker reminds kids that they’re not too much — they’re a spark.

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Dedicated to a quiet builder of worlds who grows in her own rhythm  
          and needs no one’s permission to be exactly who she is.  
          Twig honors the child who learns by doing,  
          creates her own systems,  
          and finds comfort in her own imagination.  
          Twig teaches that growth doesn’t need noise — only space.

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Dedicated to a bright, brave little soul still discovering who she is,  
          trying on the world one piece at a time.  
          Nova honors the child who arrived early but loudly,  
          the baby who feels left out even though she is the heart of the family,  
          and the mind that thinks it must prove itself.  
          Nova reminds kids that they don’t have to know who they are yet —  
          they’re allowed to bloom in their own time.
